    <p>
        My name is Jude Enrique S. Capanas, and I am currently a college student pursuing a degree in Information Technology (<i>BSIT</i>) at the Center for International Education (CIE) in Cebu. I was born and raised here with my loving family of five, consisting of my parents, an older brother, a twin, and myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
        From a young age, I have always been captivated by computers and technology. Even though I didn't have much experience with them, I found myself drawn to their endless possibilities. It was only a few years ago that I finally got my own computer, which quickly became the object of my curiosity. I may have accidentally broken a few things here and there, but I strongly believe that mistakes are an essential part of the learning process.
    </p>
    <p>
        My current mission is to expand my knowledge and skills with computers, with the ultimate goal of using this expertise to achieve something greater. It brings me great joy whenever friends or family members reach out to me for help with their devices. Finding solutions to their technological challenges and witnessing the relief on their faces fuels my determination to keep pushing forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I have other aspirations for the future, my primary focus at the moment is fully dedicating myself to my studies and making the most of the opportunities in front of me. By immersing myself in the world of information technology, I am confident that I can make a positive impact and contribute to the ever-evolving field.
