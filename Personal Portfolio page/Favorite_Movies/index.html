    <h2>These are three of my favorite movies of all time</h2>

    <div class="content-container">
        <h3>1. Weathering With You</h3>
        <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/15666683/r/il/2c8778/2175847352/il_fullxfull.2175847352_p24p.jpg" width="500">
        <p>"Weathering With You" is a Japanese animated fantasy romance film released in 2019. The film was written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. It is produced by CoMix Wave Films and distributed by Toho. The story follows a high school boy named Hodaka Morishima who runs away to Tokyo and meets a girl with the ability to control the weather, named Hina Amano. The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the impact of climate change. "Weathering With You" received critical acclaim for its beautiful animation, compelling story, and emotional depth.</p>
        <p>Some say that this film was one of Makoto Shinkai's least favorable films in terms of it's plot. However, I love it because of its "us against the world" energy. That along with its beautiful animation and amazing soundtrack has made it my favorite Makoto Shinkai film. I'd even go as far as to say that it is my favorite anime film of all time.</o>        <iframe width="791" height="445" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6iK6DjV_iE" title="Weathering With You [Official Subtitled Trailer, GKIDS]" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>Avengers: Endgame" is a 2019 superhero film directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, concluding the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga. The film follows the Avengers as they attempt to undo the devastating events of "Infinity War" orchestrated by the villain Thanos. With an ensemble cast, including Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans, the movie received widespread acclaim for its epic scale, emotional storytelling, and successful conclusion to the MCU's overarching narrative. It became one of the highest-grossing films of all time, praised for its visual effects and performances.</p>
        <p>To me, I think this movie was a great finale to a great story. I think the fact that it had been building up for so many years prior to its showing allowed all of it's audience to feel really invested into it. Oh and speaking of the audience, it's probably part of what made it such a great movie. the crowd reactions were unlike anything I had ever seen in a theater before. It's such a shame if anyone had never experienced it with such an atmosphere. Just remembering it gives me chills.</p>        <iframe width="791" height="445" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcMBFSGVi1c" title="Marvel Studios&#39; Avengers: Endgame - Official Trailer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3>3. Cars</h3>
        <img src="https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/jyn5HX7rqey5g1P50R4nm30ckm3.jpg" width="500">
        <p>Cars" is a 2006 animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Joe Ranft, the film is set in a world populated entirely by anthropomorphic cars and follows the journey of a race car named Lightning McQueen. After getting lost in a small town, McQueen learns about friendship and the importance of slowing down in life. "Cars" received positive reviews for its animation, humor, and heartwarming story. It became a commercial success and spawned sequels, making it a beloved entry in the Pixar filmography.</p>
        <p>I really do enjoy watching this one. I've seen it countless times since I was younger and I'm yet to get tired of seeing it. I even have it downloaded on my computer just in case I need something to entertain myself with and there's nothing else to do. Something about its plot and themes just speaks to me. That feeling of being in an open mid-western highway while Rascal Flatts sings "Life is a Highway" in the background feels so freeing. Such a classic!</p>        <iframe width="791" height="329" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQly7_Cj34U" title="Cars (2006) Official Trailer" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
