<a href="Personal Portfolio page/Favorite_Movies/index.html"><img src="./Previews/facorite_movies.jpg" style="display: block;margin: auto ;height: 600px;"></a>
<p>A simple page showcasing my favorite movies of all time. This page includes a brief synopsis for each of the three movies mentioned in it as well as their accompanying posters and trailers.</p>
<p>This project was created in order to demonstrate the use of lists, images, and paragraphs in HTML.</p>

<a href="Personal Portfolio page/Birthday_Invite/index.html"><img src="./Previews/birthday_invite.jpg" style="display: block;margin: auto ;height: 600px;"></a>
<p>This project showcase a page which would serve as a birthday invite. And yes, this is in fact, accurate to my birthday ^_^. </p>
<p>This project is meant to demonstrate the use of ordered lists, images and basic website design. I included an accurate birthday countdown timer, some music, and animated text too to match. The latter three are made possible with the introduction of JavaScript</p>
